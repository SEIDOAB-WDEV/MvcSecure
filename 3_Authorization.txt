Purpose:
Adding security to AppRazor and AppMvc

AppRazor: Add Serverside page level Authorization and Forbid access to a page if User not authorized to access it
AppMvc: Add Serverside Controller level Authorization and Forbid access to a Controller/Actions if User not authorized to access it

Steps:

AppRazor
--------
1. In Program.cs set Members folder to demand Authorization for all pages in the folder
builder.Services.AddRazorPages(option =>
{
    option.Conventions.AuthorizeFolder("/Members");
});

2. Execute and try to edit with and without being logged in

3. Notice that Delete group is still not authorized as authorization is done at Page level, we will solve this in next step


AppMvc
------
1. [Authorize] attribute
In Controllers/AccountController add [Authorize] attribute for AccountController class
In Controllers/GroupController add [Authorize] attribute for GroupController class
In Controllers/GroupController add [AllowAnonymous] to Actions ListOfGroups(...), SearchGroup(...)
and ViewGroup

2. Execute and try to edit with and without being logged in

3. Notice that Delete group is authorized as we use [Authorize] at Controller and Action level
